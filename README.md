This code is part of a [blog post](http://melp.nl/2012/01/declarative-is-the-new-black)

To run the examples, clone the repo, run

    make

and run one of the two examples:

    ./calculator
    ./mysum

You will need a java compiler (javac) and a c compiler (gcc) in your path for the make to succeed.
